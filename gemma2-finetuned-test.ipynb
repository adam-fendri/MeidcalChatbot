Could these symptoms be related to hypothyroidism? If so, what steps should I take to get a proper diagnosis and discuss treatment options?\n","Yes, it is possible that you may be suffering from Hypothyroidism. I would advise you to consult a physician and get your thyroid function tests done. Based on the results of these tests, your doctor will be able to prescribe you the appropriate treatment. Meanwhile, you can start taking a multivitamin supplement to help boost your energy levels. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. Regards, Dr. Gunjan Gupta, General & Family Physician\n","Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough of the hormone thyroxine. This hormone is essential for maintaining a normal body temperature and metabolism. The symptoms you are experiencing are likely to be due to low levels of thyroid hormone in your body. You will need to see a doctor for a physical examination and blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with thyroid supplements. In some cases, surgery may also be required to remove the damaged thyroid tissue. So, please consult your physician as soon as possible and let him know about my query.Hope this information was helpful and I am glad to answer any further queries.Take care.Regards,Dr. Panagiotis Armpanagiotou\n","Hi,Welcome to HCM,I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.Yes it can be hypothyroid.You should check your T3,T4,TSH levels and based on that treatment should be started.In the mean time you should take multivitamins to improve your general condition.Thanks for using HCM.Wish you good health.Please feel free to ask for follow up.Best Regards.Dr P.Murugan\n","Hypothyroid is not the only cause of your symptoms.

I am not able to sleep at night due to watery eyes. I went to the doctor, and he did an MRI and found that my eye muscles have enlarged. He gave the treatment for three months, but there was no benefit. He gave me Solu Medrol 500 mg then 250 mg injections for two months and some vitamin tablets. It is a severe problem. Please help me. What should I do?\n","Question: Q. How can I get rid of bulging eyes problem which is not getting cured with medicines? ?\n","Answer: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Bulging of the eye is known as ptosis. There are two types of ptosi, congenital and acquired. Congenital is present from birth, while acquired is acquired later in life. In your case, it seems to be acquired, as you have mentioned that it has been there for the past one year and you are taking medicines for it. You have not mentioned the MRI report, so it is difficult to comment on the exact cause. However, the most common cause is blepharospasm, a condition in which the muscles around the eyes contract, causing the eyelids to bulge. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as: 1. Nerve damage: The seventh cranial nerve (the facial nerve) is responsible for controlling eye muscle movement. Damage to this nerve can cause the eyelid muscles to become weak, leading to sagging and bulging.  2. Stroke: A stroke can affect the brain areas that control eye movement, resulting in eyelid drooping. 3. Bell's palsy: This condition, which affects the seventh nerve, can also cause eyelid sagging. Treatment options for bulging eyelids include: Botox injections: Injections of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) into the affected muscles can help relax them and reduce the appearance of eyelid swelling. Surgery: For severe cases of sagging eyelids, surgery may be necessary to correct the muscle weakness and restore normal eyelid shape. Hope this helps. Take care.
